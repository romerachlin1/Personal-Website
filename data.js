                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>I'm Rome Rachlin, a Computer Science student at Reichman University with a passion for software development, problem-solving, and building scalable, efficient software solutions through strong object-oriented programming practices. Currently working as a NOC and Tier 1 Support specialist at ThetaRay while pursuing my degree with a merit-based scholarship, with C# being my strongest programming language.</p>
                
                <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
                <p>"Rome wasn't built in a day, but every great creation starts with passion and perseverance." This motto drives my approach to both learning and development. I believe in continuous growth through self-learning, hands-on projects, and tackling complex challenges head-on.</p>
                
                <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                <p>Before transitioning into tech, I served as an IDF officer and platoon commander for nearly 5 years, where I developed crucial leadership and organizational skills. This experience taught me project management, strategic thinking, and how to perform under pressure - skills that directly enhance my approach to software development and problem-solving.</p>
                
                <h3>Technical Focus</h3>
                <p>My primary interests lie in backend development with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming principles. I'm passionate about applying OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create clean, maintainable, and scalable software solutions. My experience spans data structures, algorithms, and system architecture, always with a focus on writing well-structured, object-oriented code.</p>
                
                <h3>Current Role & Goals</h3>
                <p>In my current position at ThetaRay, I provide operational support for AI-powered AML systems, working with cutting-edge technologies while maintaining critical system uptime. This role combines my technical skills with my ability to work under pressure and coordinate with cross-functional teams.</p>
                
                <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
                <p>When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal programming projects, and yes - I'm also a Pok√©mon Champion! I believe in maintaining a balance between technical excellence and personal interests that keep me motivated and creative.</p>
